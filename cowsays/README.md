# CowSays
Intended for Mac users, this will print a cow with a random line from a file. I use this as terminal welcome page, and the file it points to has a bunch of one line puns.

## How to run
This script only takes in the location of the text file to read from. For example, "python cowsays.py <file_location>".

## Requirements
This assumes you have the following installed:
* Python (pre-installed on Macs)
* cowsay (install HomeBrew and run: "brew install cowsay")
* lolcat (install Ruby and run: "gem install lolcat")
